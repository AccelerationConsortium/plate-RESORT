## About the Project
Plate hotels and carousels are **space-efficient storage systems** designed for well plates, making them ideal for **high-throughput automated workflows** in chemistry and biology labs. This project provides **open-source, low-cost instructions** for building modular storage solutions tailored to your lab's needs.

- **Plate Hotel**: The base design accommodates **11 well plates**, but it can be easily customized to be taller or shorter depending on your requirements.
- **Plate Carousel**: Built around a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**, this system features an **automated turntable base** and can hold **6 plate hotels** (totaling **60 well plates**), enabling efficient access and organization.
