## Assembly Notes

- **BOM References:**  
  Numbers in square brackets indicate the required quantities and the corresponding part numbers from the Bill of Materials (BOM).

- **Build Configuration:**  
  This build is designed for a 2ft long rail accommodating 10 well plate slots spaced 50mm apart. Adjust the lengths and spacing for custom configurations if needed.

- **Base Plate:**  
  The base plate is intended to be screwed into a breadboard with M6 threads and 25mm spacing.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Install Heat Set Inserts:**  
   - Insert 3 heat set inserts [3x A9] into the plate hotel base [1x B2].

</p>

2. **Attach Coupling Nuts to the DIN Rail:**  
   - Secure 22 coupling nuts [22x A2] to the DIN rail using 22 M6x10mm L pan head screws [22x A4] and threadlocker [A11].  The DIN rail has 24 slots, leave the first and last slot empty (the 
   - **Note:** Ensure the screws and nuts are aligned on the right side of the DIN rail slot (the image provided shows the right side as the bottom of the rail).

</p>

3. **Prepare Components for Attaching the DIN Rail:**  
   Gather the following parts:
   - 3 M6 15mm L screws [3x A7]
   - 3 M6 spacers [3x A3]
   - 3 track nuts (from the gusset associated with part A6; use 3 out of the 6 provided)

4. **Assemble the DIN Rail to the Extrusion:**  
   - Fasten the DIN rail to the square extrusion rail by placing the screws, spacers, and track nuts at approximately the top, middle, and bottom positions.  
   - **Tip:** Align one edge of the rail with the extrusion; this aligned edge will serve as the bottom that contacts the base.  This can be done this after step 5 once the base is assembled.

5. **Attach the Rail/Extrusion Assembly to the Hotel Base:**  
   - Use gussets [3x A6] (screws and nuts included with gusset) to secure the assembly.
     - Fasten a nut along three of the extrusion tracks to attach the gusset to the extrusion.
     - Thread the remaining screw into the heat set insert [A9] to secure the gusset to the base.
   - **Ensure:** The edge of the DIN rail touches the base after installation.

6. **Install the Well Plate Trays:**  
   - Insert the 10 well plate trays [11x B1] into the coupling nuts along the rail.
   - Each tray is secured by 2 M6x10mm L flat head screws [22x A1].

7. **Final Step â€“ Cap Cover Installation:**  
   - Press the cap cover [1x A10] onto the top of the extrusion.
