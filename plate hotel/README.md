## Tools Required

- **M6 tap** (optional for Step 2)
- **Soldering iron/heat set tool**
- **Allen keys**

## Assembly Steps

1. **Install Heat Set Inserts:**  
   - Insert 3 heat set inserts [3x A10] into the plate hotel base [1x B2].

2. **Prepare the Extrusion (Optional):**  
   - Tap one end of the extrusion with an M6 tap. This end will serve as the bottom of the plate hotel.

3. **Attach Coupling Nuts to the DIN Rail:**  
   - Secure 20 coupling nuts [20x A2] to the DIN rail using 20 M6x10mm L pan head screws [20x A4] and threadlocker [A12].  
   - **Note:** Ensure the screws and nuts are aligned on the right side of the DIN rail slot (the image provided shows the right side as the bottom of the rail).

4. **Prepare Components for Attaching the DIN Rail:**  
   Gather the following parts:
   - 3 M6 15mm L screws [3x A7]
   - 3 M6 spacers [3x A3]
   - 3 track nuts (from the gusset associated with part A6; use 3 out of the 6 provided)

5. **Assemble the DIN Rail to the Extrusion:**  
   - Fasten the DIN rail to the square extrusion rail by placing the screws, spacers, and track nuts at approximately the top, middle, and bottom positions.  
   - **Tip:** Align one edge of the rail with the extrusion; this aligned edge will serve as the bottom that contacts the base.

6. **Attach the Rail/Extrusion Assembly to the Hotel Base:**  
   - Use gussets [3x A6] (which include screws and nuts) to secure the assembly.
     - Fasten a nut along three of the extrusion tracks to attach the gusset to the extrusion.
     - Thread the remaining screw into the heat set insert to secure the gusset to the base.
   - **Ensure:** The edge of the DIN rail touches the base after installation.

7. **Secure the DIN Rail (Optional):**  
   - From the back of the hotel base, screw in the M5x15mm L flat head screw [1x A9] into the DIN rail.

8. **Install the Well Plate Trays:**  
   - Insert the 10 well plate trays [10x B1] into the coupling nuts along the rail.
   - Each tray is secured by 2 M6x10mm L flat head screws [20x A1].

9. **Final Step â€“ Cap Cover Installation:**  
   - Press the cap cover [1x A11] onto the top of the extrusion.
