# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-10-16
## [2.0.6] - 2025-10-16
## [2.0.11] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- Removed unsupported `entrypoint` argument from `Flow.deploy` calls (Prefect 3.4.23 API does not accept it).

### Notes
- Run `plate-resort-deploy` again to register flows without error.

## [2.0.10] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- `deploy.py` now handles Prefect Flow objects correctly (uses `flow.fn` instead of passing Flow object to `inspect.getsourcefile`), preventing TypeError during deployment.

### Notes
- Re-run `plate-resort-deploy` after upgrading to register deployments successfully.

## [2.0.9] - 2025-10-21

### Changed
- `PlateResort.connect` now accepts optional overrides: `device`, `baudrate`, `motor_id` for flow parameter pass-through.

### Removed
- Console script entries for deleted artifacts (`plate-resort-demo`, `plate-resort-update`).

### Notes
- Function-based Prefect flows can now supply connection parameters safely without signature mismatch crashes.

## [2.0.8] - 2025-10-21

### Removed
- Legacy artifacts: `plate_resort/utils/keygen.py`, `plate_resort/utils/update.py`, `plate_resort/client/demo.py`, temporary `test_counter` Prefect flow method, duplicate `is_connected`.
- Legacy config search path entry for `resort_config.yaml`.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` now ignores `archived/`, `archived_gui/`, and `verify_prefect.py` (archives retained locally).
- Clarified hotel angle computation comment in `defaults.yaml`.
- Consolidated single `is_connected` method.

### Notes
- Archives preserved for reference but excluded from change tracking; consider moving to separate branch in future.

## [2.0.7] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- Deployment failures due to Prefect attempting to read a non-existent script path (`/home/pi/plate_resort/core.py`). Added explicit module entrypoints in `deploy.py` so flows are resolved from `plate_resort.workflows.flows:<function>` rather than inferred file paths.

### Added
- Deployment output now prints each flow's entrypoint string along with s  Stored in directory: /tmp/pip-ephem-wheel-cache-8mgnby2f/wheels/0b/aa/c0/11eecf10bed573525c496e7254c0e4a38ec0a80e991cc2e583

### Notes
- If stale `deploy.py` persists, fully uninstall (`pip uninstall -y plate-resort`), remove any `plate_resort*` directories in the venv `site-packages`, then reinstall with `--force-refresh`.


### Added
- `install.sh` flags: `--force-refresh` (delete venv + no pip cache), `--ref <git-ref>` (override branch/tag/commit for install).

### Changed
- Installer now prints the git ref used for clarity.
- Force refresh bypasses wheel and HTTP caches to ensure latest remote commit is fetched.

### Notes
- Use `--force-refresh` when suspecting stale artifacts or cached wheels.
- `--ref` enables pinning to a release tag or commit SHA for reproducible setups.


### Added
- Debug instrumentation in `plate_resort.workflows.deploy` to print source file path for each flow function during deployment.

### Fixed
- Began addressing Prefect deployment import path mismatch (`FileNotFoundError: /home/pi/plate_resort/core.py`). The package installs under `site-packages/plate_resort/` but Prefect attempted to load a filesystem path as if it were a loose script. Debug output will help confirm correct `site-packages` path on the Raspberry Pi.

### Notes
- If Prefect still resolves `/home/pi/plate_resort/core.py`, ensure the virtual environment has the package installed (not just a partial copy) and that `plate_resort` is not shadowed by a directory named `plate_resort` in `$HOME`. Remove/rename any stray `$HOME/plate_resort/` directory to avoid import shadowing.

## [2.0.4] - 2025-10-16

### Removed
- Orphaned `plate-resort-keygen` console script entry from `pyproject.toml` (legacy REST/key generation utility fully retired).

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to reflect Prefect-only architecture and environment variable based authentication (removed residual keygen / REST references).
 - Simplified `install.sh`; now auto-deploys flows and starts worker when Prefect env vars are present.
 - Bumped package version to 2.0.4.

### Notes
- Key generation is no longer part of the workflow; use Prefect Cloud API credentials via environment variables.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- `bootstrap_pi.sh` script for end-to-end fresh Raspberry Pi setup (clone, venv, deploy Prefect flows, start worker).
- `verify_prefect.py` diagnostic script to confirm Prefect Cloud connectivity, work pool presence, deployments, and recent flow runs.

### Changed
- Pinned Prefect dependency to `prefect==3.4.23` for stable flow deployment behavior.

### Notes
- Future Prefect upgrades should edit pin deliberately; run `verify_prefect.py` after any upgrade.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Resolved Prefect Cloud flow crash (SignatureMismatchError) by removing extraneous parameters from remote `connect` deployment submission.
- Updated `orchestrator.connect()` to call `run_deployment(name="connect/connect")` without a parameter dict (method flow expects only `self`).

### Notes
- Other flows (activate-hotel, move-to-angle, etc.) retain parameters matching their method signatures.
- No breaking API changes; remote client now successfully submits `connect` without crashing.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-15

### Changed
- Removed `@flow` decorators from `PlateResort` class methods to eliminate signature mismatches.
- Deployments now source only function-based flows in `plate_resort/workflows/flows.py`.
- `deploy.py` refactored to use explicit function list (`FUNCTION_FLOWS`).
- `orchestrator.connect` restored to accept device/baud/motor parameters for the function flow.

### Fixed
- Resolved repeated CRASHED flow runs caused by method-based deployments passing unexpected parameters.

### Notes
- Class still usable locally; Prefect orchestration isolated to stateless function flows.


### Added
- Prefect v3 integration for workflow orchestration
- `prefect_flows/device.py` - Prefect flows for device control
- `prefect_flows/orchestrator.py` - Remote flow execution functions
- `prefect_flows/README.md` - Setup and usage documentation

### Changed
- Added Prefect>=3.0.0 to dependencies
- REST API remains available but Prefect is now the recommended approach

### Notes
- Prefect provides better observability, retry logic, and async execution
- No breaking changes - REST API still functional for backward compatibility
