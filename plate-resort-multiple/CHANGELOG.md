# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Resolved Prefect Cloud flow crash (SignatureMismatchError) by removing extraneous parameters from remote `connect` deployment submission.
- Updated `orchestrator.connect()` to call `run_deployment(name="connect/connect")` without a parameter dict (method flow expects only `self`).

### Notes
- Other flows (activate-hotel, move-to-angle, etc.) retain parameters matching their method signatures.
- No breaking API changes; remote client now successfully submits `connect` without crashing.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Prefect v3 integration for workflow orchestration
- `prefect_flows/device.py` - Prefect flows for device control
- `prefect_flows/orchestrator.py` - Remote flow execution functions
- `prefect_flows/README.md` - Setup and usage documentation

### Changed
- Added Prefect>=3.0.0 to dependencies
- REST API remains available but Prefect is now the recommended approach

### Notes
- Prefect provides better observability, retry logic, and async execution
- No breaking changes - REST API still functional for backward compatibility

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-07
