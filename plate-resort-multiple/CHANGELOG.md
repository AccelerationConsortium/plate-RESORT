## [3.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

### üéâ Major Release: Migration to Prefect v3 Workflow Orchestration

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Replaced REST API (FastAPI) with Prefect v3 workflow orchestration
- Removed REST API server endpoints and client tools
- New workflow-based architecture for motor control

### üÜï New Workflow Architecture
- **Prefect flows**: All motor operations implemented as Prefect @flow decorated functions
- **Work pools**: Use Prefect work pools for distributed execution
- **Monitoring**: Full workflow monitoring via Prefect UI
- **Orchestration**: Chain operations together with orchestrator scripts

### ‚ú® New Features
- `device.py` - All motor control operations as Prefect flows
- `orchestrator.py` - Example orchestration script for running multiple operations
- `PREFECT_README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
- Direct flow execution or deployment-based execution
- Workflow scheduling and retry capabilities
- Distributed execution via Prefect workers

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Components
- FastAPI REST API server (`plate_resort/server/`)
- Client library and CLI tools (`plate_resort/client/`)
- `plate-resort-server` command
- `plate-resort-client` command
- API key authentication system

### üì¶ Updated Dependencies
- Removed: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`
- Added: `prefect>=3.0.0`
- Kept: `dynamixel-sdk`, `pyyaml`

### üéØ Migration Path
- Replace API calls with direct flow execution or `run_deployment()` calls
- Set up Prefect work pool instead of running REST API server
- Use Prefect UI (http://127.0.0.1:4200) instead of FastAPI docs
- Refer to PREFECT_README.md for complete migration guide

### üöÄ Benefits
- Better workflow orchestration and chaining
- Built-in scheduling and retry logic
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Distributed execution capabilities
- State management and tracking

### üéâ Major Release: Pip Package + Automatic Setup

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- Complete transformation to pip-installable package
- Simplified installation and usage
- Archived all legacy installers

### üÜï New Package Structure
- **pip installable**: `pip install git+https://github.com/...`
- **Command line tools**: `plate-resort-server`, `plate-resort-client`, `plate-resort-setup`
- **Professional package**: `plate_resort` Python package
- **Automatic setup**: System dependencies, USB permissions, API keys

### ‚ú® New Features
- One-line installation with automatic setup
- Command-line tools for server and client
- Automatic USB permissions and system configuration
- Professional Python package structure
- pip-based dependency management

### üóÇÔ∏è Archived Components
- Legacy bash installers (install.sh, update.sh)
- Standalone server/ and client/ directories
- Manual setup scripts and GUI components
- All deprecated files moved to archived/

### üîß Installation Methods
- **Recommended**: `curl ... | bash` (pip + auto-setup)
- **Manual**: `pip install ...` + `plate-resort-setup`
- **Development**: `pip install -e .` for local development

### üì¶ Package Contents
- `plate_resort.core` - Motor control logic
- `plate_resort.server` - FastAPI REST API
- `plate_resort.client` - Client library and CLI
- `plate_resort.setup` - System setup automation
- `plate_resort.keygen` - API key management

### üéØ Usage Simplification
- **Server**: `plate-resort-server` (instead of bash scripts)
- **Client**: `plate-resort-client --host IP` (consistent CLI)
- **Setup**: `plate-resort-setup` (automated system config)
- **Keys**: `plate-resort-keygen` (secure key generation)

### üöÄ Deployment Ready
- Works on any Python 3.8+ system
- Automatic Raspberry Pi detection and setup
- Professional dependency management
- Clean separation of server/client concerns
